<p>Notes:</p>
<p>This file contains some example python code to find a beta distribution when given its confidence interval, e.g., it's 90%, 95% confidence interval.</p>
<p>I am just presenting a very barebones implementation, and I'm not producing the glue code to integrate this with the rest of Squigglepy. In particular, if I move the file one folder up, I encounter this error: <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38703637/attributeerror-module-object-has-no-attribute-number">AttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute 'Number'</a></p>
<p>It does so by means of calling my personal server, which is running an instance of <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/fit-beta">this javascript package</a>. I am not making guarantees about it, but I don't intend to take it down in the near future either.</p>
<p>The other possible approach would be to implement <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nelder%E2%80%93Mead_method">Nelder Mead</a>, or other such method within Python. I don't think it would be fundamentally difficult, but it would take half a day to a few days worth of work, which feels wasteful. For that approach, see the documentation for the fit-beta <a href="https://github.com/quantified-uncertainty/fit-beta">npm package</a></p>
